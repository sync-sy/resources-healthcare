# Resources for Healthcare Software in Syria

Welcome to the `resources-healthcare` repository, part of [**sync-sy**](https://github.com/sync-sy).
This space is dedicated to organizing ideas, documentation, and coordination efforts around building and supporting healthcare information systems (HIS) in Syria.

## Purpose

- Collect and organize knowledge related to HIS development and deployment.
- Share project updates, research, and best practices.
- Use the Project Board to organize tasks, ideas, and track ongoing work.

## How to Contribute

We welcome participation from anyone interested in supporting healthcare systems in Syria.  
Please follow these guidelines based on what you want to contribute:

- **Ideas requiring live discussion or brainstorming:**  
  Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/s4FYHPvMGz) â€” this is our primary space for real-time discussions and collaboration.
- **Requests or proposed action items:**  
  Open a GitHub Issue to describe what you are proposing. Issues are the main channel for scoped feedback, requests, or problem reporting.
- **Direct updates or contributions:**  
  Submit a Pull Request for new documents, updates to existing materials, or fixes. Project maintainers will review PRs and provide feedback directly on the submission.

> **Note:**  
> While GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are good for scoped contributions, our main goal is to maintain a structured, organized knowledge base in the repository under documentation files.  
> Discussions and brainstorming should happen on Discord to keep the repo focused and easy to navigate.

- **Meetings:**  
  Community meetings will be coordinated, announced, and held via the Discord server.
